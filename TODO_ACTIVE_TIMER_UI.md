# Active Timer Screen UI Translation - Completed

## Visual Corrections Applied

1. **Background Continuity**: Smooth atmospheric gradient from #FFFDF2 to #E9E7D8

2. **River Element**: Reduced visual dominance:
   - Lower opacity (0.35→0.25 for river flow)
   - Reduced stroke width (36 instead of 44)
   - Softer gradient colors

3. **Card Grounding**: Cards now feel embedded, not floating:
   - Softer shadows (opacity 0.05-0.06, blur 10-12, offset 4-6)
   - Matches SVG shadow softness and spread

4. **Emergency Bypass**: Reduced prominence:
   - Lower saturation color (9C8585 with 0.7 opacity)
   - Softer contrast with reduced elevation (4 instead of 10)

5. **Overall Contrast Calibration**:
   - Secondary text at 0.7-0.85 opacity
   - Primary text at 0.85-0.9 opacity
   - Timer is naturally the focal point
